Tasked with creating a calculator web app, using my knowledge of Javascript/Typescript, CSS/SCSS and HTML.
At face value it is a simple calculator, which can perform simple tasks. With the `flick` of a button, it becomes a little more complex adding additional functionality, oftentimes seen in scientific calculators.. though perhaps not to the extent of some.

Clicking this link will take you to the hosted calculator app - I always appreciate feedback, good AND bad.
