# Let's create a calculator web app

## Using my knowledge of **Javascript/Typescript**, **CSS/SCSS** and **HTML**.

At face value it is a simple calculator, which can perform simple tasks. With the `flick` of a button, it becomes a little more complex adding additional functionality, oftentimes seen in scientific calculators.. > though perhaps not to the extent of some.

Clicking [this](...) will take you to the calculator app hosted on Github Pages - I always appreciate feedback.
